# pymitoqc

Python implementation of low-quality or compromised cell QC filtering adapted from the miQC R package [see here](https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/miQC.html)

Implemented here is a bayesian gaussian mixture model to find cells with a combination of 1. high mitochondrial content and 2. low number of detected genes.

Please see miQC to see which datasets this is appropriate for.
